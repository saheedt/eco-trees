# Getting Started

In your terminal of choice, run `npm install` to install all dependencies.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start:dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode. Use `ctrl + C` to exit test watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
The app is ready to be deployed!

To run the the production build, run `npm start` then navigate to [http://localhost:9000](http://localhost:9000) to view the production application in the browser.


### `npm run eject`

**Note: this application was bootstrapped with `create-react-app` and this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, there is no going back!**
